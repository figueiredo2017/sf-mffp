Food Trucks
---------------

This single app display in a user-friendly way the Approved Mobile Food Facilities in San Francisco city.

The app was designed to work with the dataset provided by
[DataSF : Mobile Food Facility Permit](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat) using only front-end coding.

I think I need to update my front-end skills so I took this opportunity to not use any back-end coding. This is my very first time coding using AngularJS.
